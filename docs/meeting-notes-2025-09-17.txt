-- no space level data:
   have data at task level,
   use DATA space for persistence / state

-- make sure subspace doesn't use its parent
-- think more on events / signals, especially spawn, despawn.
-- main space which spawns all the top-level spaces
-- better way to have path routing
-- don't need user defined events -- get rid of events in air
-- tasks have a role: what is it for?
-- path routing : we have paths going into a space that gets $used in multiple places : how does that path get routed?
-- path namings, maybe we still need to think about what the most important attributes about a path are for a user to specify... exposed functionality at target site? what kind of data going over the path?
